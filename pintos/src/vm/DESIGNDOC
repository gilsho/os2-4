			PAGE TABLE MANAGEMENT
			=====================

---- DATA STRUCTURES ----

>> A1: Copy here the declaration of each new or changed `struct' or

page supplemental table

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> A2: In a few paragraphs, describe your code for locating the frame,
>> if any, that contains the data of a given page.

a thread has a page supplemental table, which contains a pointer to the
kernel address of the frame containing the page, given that the page in
in memory.
-> upage is the hash key in the page supplemental table

>> A3: How does your code coordinate accessed and dirty bits between
>> kernel and user virtual addresses that alias a single frame, or
>> alternatively how do you avoid the issue?

We are avoiding the issue. we only access memory in kernel using 
the kernel address.
-> we may  need to set dirty+accessed manually in write, ad set
accessed in sys_read. OFFICE HOURS. need to check if we need to
do this elsewhere



---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> A4: When two user processes both need a new frame at the same time,
>> how are races avoided?

lock_frame is acquired prior to allocating a new frame, and is held 
throughout the process of eviction (if necessary) and re-mapping the 
frame to the new process

---- RATIONALE ----

>> A5: Why did you choose the data structure(s) that you did for
>> representing virtual-to-physical mappings?

-> page_supplemental table is hash for quick look up
- frame table (trick with two struct elems in pse) is list 
for consistent iteration.

THE UNION

---- ALGORITHMS ----

>> B2: When a frame is required but none is free, some frame must be
>> evicted.  Describe your code for choosing a frame to evict.

We implement the clock algorithm to decide which page to evict. Frames are stored in a list of page supplementary table entries. We maintain a global list_elem pointer, called the clock hand. The clock hand steps down the list. When it gets to the end, it moves to the head of the list and starts again. At each element, the clock hand checks the page directory to see if this page has been accessed. If so, then we clear the bit and continue. If not, then we select this frame to evict. This algorithm is an approximation of Least Recently Used. 

Because the clock must first acquire the lock for the page supplementary table before checking if it can be evicted, pages which have been 'pinned' or are having their page table entires updated are not eligible for eviction, since their locks are already acquire by another process. 

>> B3: When a process P obtains a frame that was previously used by a
>> process Q, how do you adjust the page table (and any other data
>> structures) to reflect that frame Q no longer has it?

We first call pagedir_clear_page to clear the page directory in hardware. This ensures that all future accesses to this page will page fault. We also remove the page supplementary table entry from the frame list, which means it is not in the frame table. Finally, we set the "location" field on the page supplement table entry struct to be either 'swap' or 'file' depending on where it was written to. The key is that its location is no longer set to be 'memory'.


>> B4: Explain your heuristic for deciding whether a page fault for an
>> invalid virtual address should cause the stack to be extended into
>> the page that faulted.

First we check to see if the stack address was legal - that is, we check that the address trying to be accessed is no more that 32 bytes below the current esp.

Assuming it is a legal access, we check to see if a stack extension is require. Each thread maintains a pointer to its current "stack base", which is a pointer the bottom of the memory that has been allocated for it. To check to see if we need an extension, we simply compare the faulting address to the current stack_base: if it is lower, we need to extend the stack. However, here we need another check to make sure that we are not extending beyond MIN_STACK_BASE, which represents the lowest possible address that the stack can be extended to. If we go beyond this address, we will be trespassing on the code and data segments!

---- SYNCHRONIZATION ----

>> B5: Explain the basics of your VM synchronization design.  In
>> particular, explain how it prevents deadlock.  (Refer to the
>> textbook for an explanation of the necessary conditions for
>> deadlock.)

A thread must acquire the frame table lock before making any changes to the frame table. This means that the lock is acquire when a new frame is needed, and is held until a frame has been evicted and another one has been put in its place. Furthermore, when checking a page supplementary table entry to see if it's frame can be evicted, one must hold the lock for that entry. 

To avoid deadlock, we maintain a hierarchy of lock acquisition. The frame lock must always be acquire before the lock for another page supplementary table entry is acquired. In this way we ensure that we don't have a circularity on lock acquisitions, which breaks the 4th necessary condition for deadlock.

>> B6: A page fault in process P can cause another process Q's frame
>> to be evicted.  How do you ensure that Q cannot access or modify
>> the page during the eviction process?  How do you avoid a race
>> between P evicting Q's frame and Q faulting the page back in?

While a frame is being evicted, the lock for that frame's associated page supplementary table entry is being held by the process P. The first thing that process P will do is clear the page directory for that page. This ensures that  process Q will get a page fault if it tries to access that page. Upon getting a page fault, process Q will try to acquire the lock for the page's supplementary table entry. Here it will block until process P has completely finished the eviction process. Hence, Q cannot fault the page back in until P taken it off the frame table and written it to disk (if necessary).

>> B7: Suppose a page fault in process P causes a page to be read from
>> the file system or swap.  How do you ensure that a second process Q
>> cannot interfere by e.g. attempting to evict the frame while it is
>> still being read in?

While process P was reading in a page from disk, it would be holding the frame table lock. No other process can begin the eviction process until it acquires the frame lock - hence, process Q must wait unti process P has successfully read in its page from disk before process Q can evict that page. The basic idea is that our system handles one page fault or eviction at a time. This ensures that we don't encounter race conditions between multiple evictions and page faults.

>> B8: Explain how you handle access to paged-out pages that occur

pinning. we read/write one page a time after bringing it to memory and
ensuring no one is going to evict him (by locking his pse).

Prior to reading/writing we make sure all the pages we are potentially
reading/writing from are mapped. if they aren't we kill the process

pse->lock.

filesys lock.

frame_lock.

loading a page into memory is serialized. must acquire a frame lock. ONLY
when page fault happens to we go serial All other memory accesses are almost
parallel. sometimes a pse can be acquired by frame_evict.

***should we move palloc higher up into vman_load_page?

They take on another enum. ptype->ptype_file. 

we keep track in pse of which type/origin of the memory.
switch on ptype when loading (vman_load_page_helper) and evicting (frame_evict).
if its a memory file it goes to its own file rather than to swap slot.

>> C3: Explain how you determine whether a new file mapping overlaps
>> any existing segment.

we cycle through all pages in the allocated range (start address + file
length) and ensure that they are unmapped. 
--> checkout vman_upages_unmapped()

ptype && ploc.
Code and data difference worth mentioning.

the difference between mmap and a read segment is that a read segment
can be discarded when paged out whereas a mmaped file nees to be written.

the difference between mmap and data degment is that a data segment 
once loaded needs to be written to swap whereas 
mmaped files go back to their files. we do this by checking the ptype during evict
and setting the plocation accordingly.

mmaped file is treated like a code segment when read from disk.

installation process different -> design choice. felt is cleaner interface
